# The Python compendium

This folder is intended to be a compendium of 
some of the notes I have collected through many nights of 
coding (which are going to be useful for future references). 
It is highly encouraged to recycle and make use of them in any possible way.

Most of its content may be found spread around the web, but 
the bibliography I'd like to recommend (and probably where I've got everything) 
is displayed below.

* [Bokeh](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ja-vazquez/Python_compendium/blob/master/Bokeh_examples.ipynb)
