# This script computes the grid for contours of a function
# reconstruction plot.
#
# If one has 
#  * independent variable x 
#  * dependent variable y
#  * functional form y = f(x,theta) parameterised by theta
#
# This script assumes a linear spline, with theta being interpolation
# knots, but the file fgivenx/samples.py can easily be modified
#
# Assuming that you have obtained samples of theta from an MCMC
# process, we aim to compute:
#
#               /
# P( y | x ) =  | P( y = f(x,theta) | x, theta ) dtheta ,  (1)
#               /
#
# which gives our degree of knowledge for each y value given an x value.
#
# In fact, for a more representative plot, we are not actually
# interested in the value of the probability density (1), but in fact
# require the "iso-probablity posterior mass:"
#
#                     /
# m( y | x ) =        | P(y'|x) dy'  
#                     /
#             P(y'|x) < P(y|x) 
#
# We thus need to compute this function on a rectangular grid of x and y's
#
# Once this is done, you should then use the plot_fgivenx.py script
#
# If you encounter an error, the first thing to check should be the
# limits: xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax
#
# Any questions, please email Will Handley <wh260@mrao.cam.ac.uk>

# Computing contours
# ------------------

# Read chains file and convert into a set of interpolation functions
#   - We assume that the chains file has the format:
#      <weight>    <N x coordinates>   <N y coordinates>
#     in a space - separated file (just as in getdist)
#
#   - Note that you may need to use python or awk to process a raw chains file
#
#   - It is fine for each line to have different values of N, but there 
#     shouldn't be any additional irrelevant parameters
#
